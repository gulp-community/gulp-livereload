A lightweight [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) plugin for livereload best used with the [livereload chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei).

Install
---

```
npm install --save-dev gulp-livereload
```

3.x Upgrade Notice
---

`gulp-livereload` will not automatically listen for changes. You now have to manually call `livereload.listen` or enable auto start.
More details below...

API & Variables
---

livereload uses a config object throughout its methods and while you never have to
use this, it is useful if you want to set configuration directly only once.

    livereload.options.port                     Server port
    livereload.options.host                     Server host
    livereload.options.basePath                 Path to prepend all given paths
    livereload.options.start                    Automatically start
    livereload.options.quiet        false       Disable console logging
    livereload.options.reloadPage   index.html  Path to the page the browsers on for a full page reload

livereload also reveals the underlying server instance for direct access if needed. The instance
is a "tiny-lr" instance that this wraps around. If the server is not running then this will be undefined.

    livereload.server

You can also directly access the middleware of the underlying server instance (tiny-lr.middleware) for
hookup through express, connect, or some other middleware app

    livereload.middleware

To start livereload up and running, use this command. It takes an optional options parameter that is the
same as the global one noted above. If none is present is uses the above one. Also you dont need to worry with multiple instances as
this function will end immidiately if the server is already runing. 

    livereload.listen(options)

You can manually, yourself, send a change notification of a single file to the browser causing the browser to reload that change.
All it requires is a single file path. Do also note that the basePath is not forgotten about and will be applied to the path if 
provided or previosuly setup.

You may provide a simple string or an object, if an object is given it expects a property called "path" to be present on it

    livereload.changed(path)

You can also tell the browser to refresh the entire page, including all the assets on the page as opposed to individual assets.
This works best for single-page apps but can work on any setup. Essentially you need to refresh the page the browser is currently on.
With single-apge apps its just one page, if not then it must be the current page in the browser.

However it's setup, this assumes the page is called "index.html", you can change it by providing an optional new path to use as a
string or change it globally with the options object exposed and mentioned above.

The base path is not forgotten about and will also be applied if setup

    livereload.reload(path)

Finally theres the Gulp pipe stream function, the most important function, which automatically sends the destination file through
`livereload.changed`

    livereload(options)

Example
---

```javascript
var gulp = require('gulp'),
    less = require('gulp-less'),
    livereload = require('gulp-livereload');

gulp.task('less', function() {
  gulp.src('less/*.less')
    .pipe(less())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('css'))
    .pipe(livereload());
});

gulp.task('watch', function() {
  livereload.listen();
  gulp.watch('less/*.less', ['less']);
});
```

See [examples](examples).

Debugging
---

Set the `DEBUG` environment variables to `*` to see what's going on


```
$ DEBUG=* gulp <task>
```

Common Problems
---

Here are some common problems you may encounter and the common fix for it

* **LiveRelaod is integrated and everything seems to be going A-OK but nothings happening on the client side**

    The usual problem, especially for people new to LiveReload, is that the change signals are being pushed to your browser
    but they aren't being pulled in. LiveReload also must be present in the browser and the process is different for each
    supported browser.
    
    The other problem is, after you have it installed in your browser, it may not be enabled. LiveReload is usually 
    always disabled unless either explicitly enabled or you provide a LiveReload script tag into the page which
    forces LiveReload to always become enabled on the browser if its instaled.
    
* **After setting up this plugin, my website has been replaced by either a white page or square brackets**

    LiveReload cannot be on the same port as your webserver, change the port over to a different port or
    dont explicitly set a port number. Also keep in mind that as per the LiveReload standards, the official port number is
    35729 in case you prefer to explicitly set the port number to the default port.
